```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis-coder.git
cd jarvis-coder
````

### 2. Install dependencies

### 3. Set API base URL

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure your local backend (Ollama API or equivalent) is running on the same port.

## ‚ö° Backend Setup (Ollama Example)

If you are using **Ollama** as your local LLM backend:

1. **Install Ollama**
   [https://ollama.ai/download](https://ollama.ai/download)

2. **Run your desired models**

   ```bash
   ollama pull deepseek-coder:33b
   ollama pull mistral:7b-instruct
   ollama pull qwen2.5:14b-instruct
   ```

3. **Start the backend server**
   If using a Node/Express wrapper, run:

   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

   Make sure it‚Äôs listening at `http://127.0.0.1:4000`.

## üí° Tip

If you get:

```
Couldn't read installed models. Got HTML from server. Check REACT_APP_API_BASE.
```

It means the API URL is wrong or the backend isn‚Äôt running.
Verify `.env` and ensure the backend is reachable at that address.

```

If you want, I can also make a **shorter, flashy version** for your GitHub with animated GIFs showing Helix in action so it feels more like a showcase. That would make the repo stand out a lot.
